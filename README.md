# The Hacker News App (clone)

This is a [thehackernews.com](https://thehackernews.com/) clone. You can search any news on the search bar, page through the results using the pagination at the bottom of the page, and select any news you would want to see in detail. This project was made using React and Redux, and the UI styling was done with Bootstrap. The data displayed (news articles) was obtained from the [Google NewsApi](https://newsapi.org/).

## Page Breakdown

1. **Header:** By clicking on the logo (_THE HACKER NEWS_) you will be redirected to the home page.
2. **Search Bar:** You can type in your search, clear out what you have typed using the 'x' button at the right side of the search bar, and do a search either by pressing the 'Enter' key or by clicking the blue search icon at the right side of the search bar. You can also clear out the search bar on focus.
3. **News List:** When you select the news you would want to see in detail, you will be redirected to another page where the selected news will be expanded and the content of the news will be accessed.
4. **Popular This Week:** This section has the same functionality as the News List (^).
5. **Pagination:** You can page through the news articles by clicking either the number, the previous, or the next buttons. When doing a new search or when clicking the logo, the page 1 of the pagination will become active.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
